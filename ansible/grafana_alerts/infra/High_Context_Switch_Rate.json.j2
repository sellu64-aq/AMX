    "description": "🧐 **Why This Happens**\n- Excessive process scheduling activity due to high number of runnable tasks.\n- Many short-lived threads or processes (e.g., thread-per-request design).\n- High interrupt rates from hardware or I/O devices.\n- Contention for CPU resources due to poor affinity settings or NUMA imbalance.\n\n🔍 **Impact**\n- Increased CPU overhead due to context switching.\n- Reduced effective CPU time for applications.\n- Potential latency spikes or performance degradation in critical workloads.\n\n✅ **Immediate Actions for Ops**\n1. **Check context switch rate in real-time:**\n   ```\n   vmstat 1 10\n   ```\n   Look at `cs` column (context switches per second).\n2. Identify top processes contributing to context switches:\n   ```\n   pidstat -w 1 5 | sort -k6 -nr | head\n   ```\n3. Check for high interrupt rates:\n   ```\n   cat /proc/interrupts | sort -k2 -nr | head\n   ```\n4. Investigate application design:\n   - Too many threads or processes?\n   - Frequent blocking/unblocking calls?\n5. Consider tuning:\n   - Increase CPU affinity or pin processes to reduce cross-CPU switches.\n   - Reduce thread creation/destruction overhead.\n6. If caused by interrupts, check device drivers or hardware load distribution.\n\n⚠ **Note:** This alert triggers if `context_switches` derivative exceeds **50,000 per second** for 5 minutes. Tune threshold based on workload."
